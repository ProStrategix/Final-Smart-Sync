I have validated the program up to the point of normalization.  I have an array of normalized rows. The task at hand is to  split these data into two arrays of objects where these objects will share at leasted a shared key.

Data Obj : {
	'_id:string',
	'Created Date: auto gen',
	'Updated Date: auto gen',
	'Owner: auto gen','
	rowId: critical shared key MUST ALWAYS BE HERE',
	'Headline: Name Shown on Display',
	'Name:productName is DB',
	'Strain: one of three',
	'Category:string',
	'FormattedPrice:$XX.XX',
	'unitPrice:number xx.xx'
	}
	
	Image Obj : {
		'Status:string',
		'Productname: auto gen',
		'Product Id: auto gen',
		'Imageurl: auto gen',
		'Rowid: critical shared key MUST ALWAYS BE HERE'
		}				

keys of Error Obj === keys of Image Obj  

For each normalized row  => one data object row and one image object row.

While we are splitting the data, we also want to categorize each of the main image url or file path.  These are the groups. Each will need to be tested - none shall be guessed.

	1.	 Callable and Downloadable. - this url leads to a legit address where a file can be downloaded.
	2. Wix URL - these are urls from a store from different site so you cannot pass them through. Use Regex for this
	3. Local files - path is local storage path not a url.
	4. No URL No Local => Error ->  create an error row
	5. invalid url, not callable, not downloadable => Error

Here there are 5 as every url must map to one of these categories.  When complete, we assign a label to whole array, it either all 1-5 or mixed (capture categories)

We will start here. Complet this section. Validate and then move forward.
